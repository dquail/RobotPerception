#Robot Perception
Within this repository we are attempting to acheive computational perception via Reinforcement learning and robots.

There are several parts to this and thus, several layers of documentation.

###[ROS Setup](Documentation/ROS Setup/README.md)
Provides steps required to install ROS, and begin to send command to a dynamixel servo, as well as reading data from the servo.

###[General value function experiments](Documentation/RobotModule2/README.md)
Describes answering 3 predictive questions about the future using 3 different general value functions.
